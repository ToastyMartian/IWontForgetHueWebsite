You have the ability to craft new glasses making you able to see even more of the seemingly multi-coloured house.</p>
                    <p>During your journey through the house you will hear many noises that seem impossible to explain. But these noises have a cause, only you can’t see them, yet. But once you see them using the correct glasses, they will see you too. Chasing you down the hallways, not letting you have any rest in this altering house.</p>

                    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                    <p>In I Won’t Forget Hue, you will be walking around the narrow hallways and rooms of a dark, old house. But while you explore this mansion, you find that you might not be alone. Different glasses cause the house around you to change. Once the evil finds you looking around, it will chase you all over. You must find a way to use the colours to your advantage, to find new parts and figure out what how to hide from the evil. All while you try to figure out what happened to the rest of your family. But beware as the game progresses, the evil increases.</p>
                    <p>Play alone in this 3D single player game. Find and use the coloured lenses and torn painting pieces. Switch between the different coloured lenses on your glasses to see new parts of the mansion, but also see the evil that hides within it. Stay out of sight when in colour, and find ways to hide from the enemies. Try different types of strategies to discover and progress.</p>
